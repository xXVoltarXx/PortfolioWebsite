									<h2>Producer Goal</h2>
									<h3>Lead a Small and Nimble Team and Play to Everyone's Strengths</h3>
									<p>
										Spell Forge is an ambitious project for a small team of 7. Full deterministic physics utilizing Photon Quantum, 2 Massive Maps with hordes of enemies and a final boss, PvPvE Spellcrafting gameplay inspired by <i>Noita</i> with a final BuildvBuildvBuildvBuild battle at the end, 14 Unique Primary Artifacts and 12 Enchantments that can stack and augment them, and a Retro Aesthetic along with so much more. Granted, while I didn't expect the game to have this content when I first joined the project, I always knew from the beginning that I was going to have to keep this team nimble and utilizes everyone's strengths to optimize our efficency. These exact traits and ideas are why I was chosen to be a Producer on this project <b>according to my own professor.</b> However, there was one hurdle I had to overcome...
									</p>
									<h3>Being a Producer and Expanding the Team on a Project Where Half of the People Have Been Working Together on it for a Month Already</h3>
									<p>
										This hurdle is the one that I was most worried about, and it's a hurdle I overcame quickly. Due to my prior work experience with my team members, I was able to integrate smoothly and help the team grow without disrupting the existing dynamics. <b>By also talking to and understanding the development of certain aspects of the game for Disciplines I don't consider myself a part of, like Art, I was able to create and manage tasks efficiently and keep the project on track.</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										I also utilized <b>Trello</b>, <b>Waterfall Methodology</b>, <b>Disclipline Meetings</b>, and created a <b>project-and-discpline-wide Asset List</b> to help everone on the project stay on track and know what tasks to prioritize. This was especially helpful when the <b>Main Design of the Game</b> had to <b>Pivot to Something Else.</b>

									<h2>Making a Massive Pivot - Producing and Design</h2>
									<h3>The Realization</h3>
									<p>
										Prior to my involvement in the project, Spell Forge was a very simple game. Each player was on their own copy of the single small map, they killed enemies, collected up to 1 artifact and enchantment, and then fought each other with those in the final battle once the game timer expired. The previous team made the decision that the game should <b>increase in complexity</b> in order to make it more replayable. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Upon joining the project in the early summer leading up to a semester of development, I worked with the team and the other Designer to come up with how we could increase the complexity of the game while still keeping close to the game's core vision, <b>PvP Spellcrafting.</b> Our solution was  <b>in-match minigames,</b> such as Capture-the-Flag, Hot Potato, King of the Hill, etc. With inspiration from <i>Kirby Air Riders</i> we believed we were on the right track and we worked on these modes during the summer. However, when the semester started and we started to get feedback on it, we realized that while we did increase the game's replayability, <b>the core player gameloop was still too simple</b> and not engaging enough for prolonged play. Upon realizing that we added more content to a <b>foundation that was too simple,</b> we <b>scrapped our entire summer work</b> and <b>started back at the beginning.</b>
									</p>
									<h3>Redesigning Core Gameplay</h3>
									<p>
										With this massive setback putting us behind our original semester-long schedule, the other Designer and I had to quickly come up with the new core design of the game and I had to plan out the rest of the semester with the team. After deliberating for a while and doing tests, we decided to take inspiration from <i>Noita</i> and its Spellcrafting system which then expanded into the game that Spell Forge is today (as explained at the top of the page)
									</p>
									<h3>The Result and Reflection on the Pivot</h3>
									<p>
										People loved the game. While its complexity did take some getting use to, the issue with the original design was solved and the game turned out how we all wanted to be. As a Producer, I was thrown into a situation where I had to manage a pivot that could have been disastrous for the project if it didn't succeed, but by working with the team and communicating with them, we were able to make the pivot successful and we ended up with a much better game because of it.

									<h2>On-Screen Controls and Dynamic Glyphs</h2>
									<h3>The Problem - Forgetting Controls</h3>
									<p>
										One issue found while playtesting the game was that players were having a hard time remembering what button did what, especially with <b>inventory navigation</b>. This was especially a problem for new players who hadn't had the time to learn the controls yet. We needed a way to help players learn the controls and remember them during gameplay without having to pause the game and look at a control scheme or something like that.
									</p>
									<h3>The Solution - Dynamic On-Screen Controls with Controller Glyphs</h3>
									<p>
										<p>While the solution does make the game's UI more cluttered, it greatly improves the player's ability to learn and remember the controls. By dynamically displaying the correct controller glyphs based on the player's input device, we ensure that the information is always relevant and easy to understand.</p>
									</p>
									
									<h3>How I Did It</h3>
									<p>
										I accomplished this by attaching two functions on our <i>PlayerCanvas</i> script which handles the player information and then a single script that is on the Glyph object itself. <br><br>Essentially, <b>SetUpGlyphs()</b> gets the <i>PlayerInput</i> component for the desired <i>local player index</i> and the call <b>UpdateGlyphs()</b>. <br><br>This function gets the current controller's name and then tells every Glyph what it is. I took great care in researching the internal name of every controller (specifically Playstation) so that any Xbox and Playstation controller would work.<br><br>Then, the Glyph script with <b>SetGlyph()</b> takes that information and changes the Sprite of the Glyph to the correct one based on the input device. I also designed it in such a way that some glyphs only popped up if they were needed. For example, Dash only has <b>one binding on keyboard but two on controller,</b> so the extra glyph is hidden when using Mouse and Keyboard.
									</p>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									<p>
										This had an immediate postive effect on players' ability to learn and remember the controls. It also made the game more accessible to new players who may not be familiar with the controls yet which resulted in them giving us better playtesting feedback.

									<h2>UI Design - Clean and Accessible During Split-Screen</h2>
									<h3>My Vision</h3>
									<p>
										As the sole UI-Designer, my goals were the following:
										<ul>
											<li>Design a Clean and Minimalistic UI</li>
											<li>Make Sure the UI was Accessible and Readable During Split-Screen Gameplay</li>
											<li>Limit the Places the Player Needs to Look At</li>
											<li>Ensure that the UI was Able to be Easily Modified by Programmers if Needed</li>
										</ul>
										There were limits to this goal though, as the complexity of Spell Forge required a pretty complex UI. But, I tried to keep it as simple as I could.<br><br>
										With the <b>In-Game UI</b>, I decided to <b>show the important information near the player</b> with further detail being at the bottom of the screen. This can be seen with the <b>health and mana bars by the player.</b><br><br>
										With the <b>Info Screen UI</b> the goal was to show only information that couldn't fit on the in-game UI so that the screen wasn't cluttered. Here, the player can see the minimap, the power level of every player in the game, their current artifact and description, and the currently selected enchantment and its description and stats. The screen was kept semi-transparent so that players could still see the game and be aware of what was going on while they were looking at the info screen. <b>It should be noted that this screen is not meant to be seen that much during gameplay. It's meant to be a quick glance and that's it.</b> Hence why its items are pretty large.<br><br>
										The big challenge with this UI was keeping it all <b>readable while playing locally with up to 3 other players.</b> So, this resulted in me having clear shapes and having UI elements be large so that it is visible even when the screen is split into 4. I also made sure to use color and contrast to make sure that the UI stood out against the game and was easy to read. I took heavily inspiration from <i>Minecraft's</i> UI for this as it was <b>proven to work well.</b><br><br>
										In the next section, you can see some of the other UI layouts I designed for the game.
