            <span id="smallTextAbout">Welcome! I'm Michael Kleinbriel, an Honors Junior at Michigan State University, and I'm currently in the Games and Interactive Media major at MSU with the goal of joining the Game Development Minor.<br><br>
  
            I've been a big fan of video games my entire life and I've always had my dream set on making video games. Every year I have been teaching myself or taking classes in order to improve my skills for video game development. Currently, the fields of game development that I really enjoy are Game Design and Game Programming, with an emphasis on design. I personally believe that these two fields go hand in hand with each other when making games on your own but in a team of 80 people like MSU's Spartasoft Studio club, my specialty is Design. I especially find level design to be very fun for me to do.<br><br>
            
            I have 9 years of Blender experience, I'm proficient in Unity, and I'm currently a beginner in Unreal Engine (which I'm learning more about). I have video game programming experience with C#, Java, and Blueprints, and I have non-video game programming experience with C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python.<br><br>
            
            My current video game project is a physics-based VR game called Peril in Paradise. I'm also a part of other school projects too. Right now, I'm a ULA for CSE 102 where I help teach Business Students Python, and I'm a Design Director at MSU's Spartasoft Studio club for the Spring 2024 semester. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with my family, and playing tennis.</span>
