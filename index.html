          <span id = "smallTextAbout">Welcome! My name is Michael Kleinbriel and I'm currently an Honors Junior at Michigan State University for Games & Interactive Media with the intention of joining the Game Development Minor.

            My dream is to become a Game Developer and work at a AAA studio while making Indie games with a focus on VR in my free time.

            I have 8 years of 3D Modeling, Animation, and Rendering experience with Blender and I've been making games since I was in elementary school. My areas of expertise for Game Development are Design and Programming and I have some experience with Music and Writing.<br>
  
            Recently, I've had the privilege of being a part of MSU's AI Club where I received the Most Involved Member award for the two semesters that I've been in it so far. I also had the privilege of being in the Spartasoft Studio Game Development Club at MSU where I was a QA tester on <strong><a href="https://spartasoftstudio.itch.io/tomb-for-two">Tomb for Two</a></strong> and a Designer for <strong><a href="https://spartasoftstudio.itch.io/sneakeasy">Sneak Easy</a></strong>. For Sneak Easy, I focused on designing the player and the levels that are present in the game.<br>
            
            Outside of Game Development, I have programming experience with Python, Html, CSS, Javascript, Java, C#, and C++. In my free time, I enjoy playing Tennis and hanging out with my family.</span>
