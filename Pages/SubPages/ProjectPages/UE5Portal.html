        <div id = "projectText">
          <p>For the final project in MI 330, we were tasked to follow an Unreal Engine tutorial and then make modifications to it in order to make our own thing. So, I followed a portal tutorial and then made a test map along with numerous additions and mainly optimizations to the portal system in order to make it usable in an actual game.</p>
          <p>Here is what I added (which the video goes into depth about and shows the code for):<br>
            1. Player is now resized to exit portal size. So, if you exit a small portal, you are also small<br>
            2. Portal render targets rescale based on player distance. Close proximity means high res, far means low res<br>
            3. Portal render targets only render when the player is both looking at them and within 50 meters<br>
          </p>
          <p>Although it only ended up being three additions, I'm very happy with my current blueprint code and I think it turned out pretty well considering that this was the first time I used UE5's blueprints before to make something complex. Before this, the only blueprint I've ever made was for my snow particle system to follow and rotate with the player camera on my UE5 Grappler level. All in all, I really loved working with Unreal Engine 5 and I will be working with it more in my future. This project was a great starting point to prove to myself that I can learn Unreal Engine 5 without that much difficulty and be able to make somewhat complex code. It's way easier for me to think about how I would do something in Unity and then translate that to Unreal Blueprints. The only issue with Unreal's Blueprints is its weird function names and terrible search! :)</p>
