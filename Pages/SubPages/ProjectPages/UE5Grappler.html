        <div id = "projectText">
          <p>This project was made for MI 330 and it pretty much served as my first time using Unreal Engine 5. I've only used Unreal Engine for a little bit before this when I used to try and attempt mapping for the latest Unreal Tournament and Fornite's UEFN but I barely got far in those. Anyways, the goal of this project was to use the grappler player made by Jeremy Bond and make a fun grappler level.</p>
          <p>When making this map, I pretty much entirely used Unreal Engine's cube grid system so that I could get the nice blocky layouts. I also messed around with some Unreal's landscape tools to make the landscape and Unreal's blueprint and materials editors to make the falling snow that follows the player and the recursive MSU green material shader thing. I especially liked the snow that I made because I made the particles react to light which makes the level look very pretty indoors in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Anyways, this level was initially pretty short. After you left the inside area near the mountain, the player initially just climbed up the mountain to the top. The biggest feedback I got from the level was that it was just so much fun to play that people wanted more. So, I added more. Now you go into a giant frictionless slide (which actually has a huge invisible cone for collision which means it's impossible for some to miss or mess up) and then you jump around a giant room before finishing with flying through hoops Superman64-style until you reach the end.</p>
          <p>My level was praised for how it looked visually and for how fun it felt to play. Players also felt that the difficulty was just right and people took notice on how every jump had the perfect distance to it. I'm happy that people noticed that because I played this level around 50 times while making it and I did that so that I could have all of the jumps feel good. The cube grid system definitely helped with that. In the end, I really like the final version of this level and I think it's very fun to play. It also showed to me that making levels in Unreal isn't that bad. Although, it still doesn't beat Valve's Hammer Editor though! :P</p>
