          <p>This map was made using the Metroid Map editor tool provided by Jeremy Bond.</p>
          <p>This was a very fun map to make. It was the first project for MI 330 and I guess you could say that it was my first time trying to make an actual map that tells a story. As shown in the video, this is a very linear map which is uncommon for Metroid. The story is that Samus is being tested upon and she has to complete tests in order reach the exit. The reasons for her tests, however, are unknown...</p>
          <p>This map didn't really go through a lot of revisions. Pretty much the only changes between versions was making some jumps easier, adding some more text, and decorating the environment. All of the feedback that I got from the level was that players loved how the environment naturally told them where to go with "subtle" arrows pointing in the correct direction, just like what the original Metroid game did. Playtesters loved how I introduce each mechanic and teach the player how to use them. My favorite is the bomb powerup and how I make the player go up by shooting and go down by bombing the floor. My other favorite is the ice powerup and the giant climb I have the player do. Overall, although this is a pretty simple level, I still love the final product!</p>
