          <p>This is a project that I worked on in Spartasoft Studio as a designer in Spring 2023<br><br><a href="https://spartasoftstudio.itch.io/sneakeasy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Click Here to Visit Itch Page</u></a></p>
          <p><br>Sneak Easy is a 2D stealth platformer with parkour where the player has to steal a diamond from Goliath Inc. This was a very fun game to work on and I learned a lot while being on the Design team. As a designer, I was a part of three different design teams throughout the semester. At the very beginning of the semester, I was part of the Player team which was composed of me and one other person. We both were responsible for coming up with how the player felt, looked, and acted in the game. We both worked together to answer those questions and we worked with the player programmers, artist, and audio teams in order to have our vision of the player come to fruition. <br><br>During this process, we also worked with the story team to come up with the game's story and then I was assigned to think of the theme for the first area of the game, which ended up being the Slums. After that, I was assigned to be a level designer in which I made four different levels. Due to some design changes later on in the game's development, three of my levels had to be cut. The google slideshow above showcases each of the four levels and provides a description about each one. I highly reccommend looking at all of them, there were really fun to make! Especially the Slum City and Cargo Crate levels.<br><br>Another thing I did on the design team was make prefabs for the other level designers to use in their levels. This included many environment prefabs and lots of items that helped make the game's electricity system obvious. Some of my favorite ones included lights which were linked to electricity and then a wire spline system in which designers could place purely-visual wires to connect multiple objects in order to visually demonstrate to the player what objects were connected to each other.</p>
