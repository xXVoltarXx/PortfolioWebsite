          <p>Market Mayhem is a multiplayer hide and seek game that I worked on in Fall of 2023 as a level designer and did some management for in the first half of the Spring Semester of 2024 as a Design Director. This was a very fun game to work on and it really helped me get used to working with a team while making a single map. It also helped introduce me to management when Spartasoft Studio worked on it for the first half of the Spring 2024 semester.</p>
          <p>Let's start with my level design work in Fall of 2023. This project really helped introduce me to making a multiplayer map and working with a team. The map that I helped come up with and work on was the Warehouse map which is featured predominately in the trailer (it's the map with the catwalk, shelves, drones, and cargo ship). Initially, the four of us in our level team decided to make a warehouse map and then we each decided on what area to add to it or focus on. My area was entirely the Cargo Ship and Docks. So, I was in charge of getting the required art assets, building out the blockouts of that area, meeting with art to decide the visual style of the ship and docks, and then adding the water at the very end. Because this map wasn't being made solely by me, I also addressed any concerns or questions that my teammates gave me and I did the same for them. The biggest changes I made were to the box placements inside and outside of the cargo ship and on the docks. I wanted it to be fun to play. Our team finished our map very quickly and we were even asked to start designing a second map but that idea ended up being scrapped due to issues with Market Mayhem. After that, we all spent time making the map better to play. In the end, I am happy with the final version of the map but I don't think it's anywhere near being finished. This was due to some Market Mayhem issues which were out of our control but nevertheless, I believe that I did my best on my portion of the map and that my team did too.</p>
          <p>In the Spring 2024 semester, I became a Design Director for Spartasoft Studio and along with making documents for Goose Genie, my partner and I were also tasked with getting Market Mayhem reading for semester #2, a first for Spartasoft Studio. This helped introduce me to Design management as I now had access to all of the previous documents and my partner and I had to make new ones for the new teams during the semester. We had to also come up with some new ideas for the game and have our Market Mayhem team do the same. Sadly though, this work went mostly unused as it was decided halfway through the semester to scrap Market Mayhem and put the entire studio on Goose Genie. This was a smart choice and I'm happy for the skills that my three and a half weeks of managing Market Mayhem's design taught me.</p>
          <p>In the end, Market Mayhem helped improve my level design skills by working on a multiplayer game with a team and it taught me some new management skills for the short time it was being continued in its second semester.</p>
