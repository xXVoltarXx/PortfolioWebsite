          <p>Tomb for Two was the first project I worked on for Spartasoft Studio and I was a part of the first ever QA team. This was a very fun game to provide feedback for and it taught me a lot about how games are made. At this point, it was my first semester in college and at that point, I didn't really know the inside and outside of making a video game with a big team.</p>
          <p>As a QA member, I was assigned multiple different tasks to do throughout the semester. At the beginning, I was assigned a partner and our goal was to create a presentation about how to make a good puzzle game which Design would then use when designing their puzzles. My partner and I analyzed Portal 2 and because Tomb for Two is a co-op game, we specifically looked at the co-op puzzles in Portal 2 and explained what made them fun and unique. After doing this, we were then assigned with playtesting the game every week and providing feedback to the rest of the team. Personally, I filled out feedback around three times a week (which is when new builds were provided) and made sure that my feedback was highly detailed and I even provided some possible solutions to certain issues that I found. In the end, only around me and 5 other people made it to the end of the semester on QA without quitting. The rest of the team didn't seem to be as enthusiastic as us 6 so they all sadly dropped out of the club before the launch party. Nevertheless though, I really enjoyed being on the QA team and it taught me a lot about Spartasoft Studio's process of making games.</p>
          <p>One big thing that this experience taught me was that some people just ignore QA feedback which is obviously not good. Sometimes the issues that QA would point out would never get resolved and they are still present in the final game when they could have been fixed beforehand. So, when I became a part of the design team for Sneak Easy and Market Mayhem and Design Director for Goose Genie, I tried my best to ensure that QA's feedback gets seen and heard. On my own levels, I would address all of the feedback that I got instantly and then ask the QA testers to play my level again to see if it was better or not. As a Director, I'm making sure that QA's feedback is presented nicely for my teams to look through and address and my partner and I try to keep the Designers responsible in addressing QA feedback and not blowing it off. Although, we haven't had any issues with that! :)</p>
          <p>In the end, my QA experience on Tomb for Two was very positive and I learned a lot while being on the team</p>
